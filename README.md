# Project Zomboid 3D Tiles
### 🔎What is this?
I’m experimenting with a **3D approach to tile creation**—a method that could apply to a broader range of assets.

### 🎯Goals
The idea is to make the workflow more **procedural**, so that manual work is minimal—mostly just tweaking sliders.


- All textures are procedural, generated with a random seed.🌀
- Multiple render layers (depth, shadow, normals, etc.) are being tested.
- Long-term curiosity: could these 2D tiles eventually respond to **dynamic lighting**? 🌝
